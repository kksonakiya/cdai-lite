## ✅ Prerequisites

- Python 3.12.x or higher installed

## 📦 Step-by-Step Setup

### 1️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

This ensures all dependencies stay isolated.

cd cdai-env\Scripts
activate
```

**macOS/Linux:**

```

You should now see `(cdai-env)` in your terminal prompt.

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies

Make sure you're in the **project root directory** where `requirements.txt` is located.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 4️⃣ Run the App

From the root directory, start the app with:

```bash
python run.py
```

This will launch the CDAI Lite application locally.

## 💡 Tips

- Always activate your virtual environment before running the app.
- If you run into errors during install, ensure you're using the correct Python version.
- To deactivate the virtual environment, just run:

```bash
deactivate
```
